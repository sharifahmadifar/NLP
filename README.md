Politics of emotions or propaganda? (P3)
This project explores how emotional language is used strategically in political texts, such as speeches, social media posts, or debates—to influence perception and manipulate audience response. Students will design a pipeline using transformer-based models to detect emotional framing, categorize tone (e.g., fear, pride, outrage), and highlight shifts in sentiment across political stances or media sources. The goal is not just to classify emotion, but to interpret its rhetorical function within the discourse. In order to perform the task, the project should:
Use pre-trained transformer models (e.g. RoBERTa, BERT fine-tuned on GoEmotions) to classify emotions expressed in each text.
Examine how specific emotions (e.g. fear, anger, pride) are used across parties, time periods, or topics to shape opinion.
Create plots or dashboards comparing emotional tone across actors, media types, or ideological groups.
Apply explainability methods (e.g. SHAP, attention heatmaps) to highlight emotional trigger words and rhetorical patterns.
